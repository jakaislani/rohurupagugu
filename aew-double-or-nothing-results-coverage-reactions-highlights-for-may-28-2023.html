Backstage, RJ City provided updates and enthusiastically emphasized that every AEW championship would be up for grabs throughout the pay-per-view event.</p><p>The hosts meticulously discussed the lineup of the show, followed by an engaging video package showcasing the intense Anarchy in the Arena match.</p><p>To provide additional context and build anticipation, a segment featured a clip from Jim Ross’s sit-down interview with Don Callis. In the interview, Callis expressed that he had undertaken the most challenging task any parent or family member could face. He stated firmly that he had taken decisive action to eliminate the destructive element, referring to it as “cutting out the cancer.” Callis directed a piercing gaze into the camera and boldly declared, “Kenny, I haven’t even started cutting.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>In the backstage area, RJ City engaged in an interview with Arn Anderson, delving into the upcoming events. City pointed out that it appeared Wardlow was inadvertently playing into Christian Cage’s strategy by accepting a ladder match. Anderson countered by asserting that no one had been coerced into the match, emphasizing the abilities of Wardlow. When City inquired about Anderson having a weapon at ringside, Anderson wittily replied, “Ask your momma.”</p><p>A compelling video package showcased the AEW Women’s Championship match, prompting the panel to share their insights. Paul Wight cleverly quipped that he had experienced more turns than NASCAR.</p><p>Following that, a video package provided insights into the intense feud between Adam Cole and Chris Jericho, highlighting the addition of Sabu to Cole’s corner. Additionally, a brief video on the AEW Tag Team Title match was aired, leading the panel to offer their thoughts and predictions on the upcoming bout.</p><p>The arena resonated with the sound of the Oklahoma fight song as Jim Ross made his entrance, joining Excalibur and Taz at the ringside desk, which was a fresh addition to the setup. Excalibur took the opportunity to mention the company’s fantasy sports partner, setting the stage for an advertisement that was subsequently aired.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Taz expressed his enthusiasm for being ringside, relishing the opportunity it presented. Jim Ross, sharing his thoughts, proclaimed that the show held an aura of mystery and anticipated it to be one of the most physically intense productions in the company’s history. With confidence, Ross gazed into the camera and assured the viewers that they would absolutely love it.</p><p>The entrances for the pre-show match commenced as ring announcer Justin Roberts introduced Ethan Page, Colten Gunn, and Austin Gunn. Hook, making his way to the ramp, stood poised for action while awaiting the arrival of Matt Hardy, Jeff Hardy, and Isiah “Brother Zay” Kassidy. Notably, Kassidy appeared wearing a bedazzled neck brace, adding a touch of flamboyance to his look.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Matt Hardy, Jeff Hardy, and Hook vs. Ethan Page, Colten Gunn, and Austin Gunn</h2><p>The commentary team emphasized the stipulation that if Matt Hardy’s team emerged victorious, he would gain control of Ethan Page’s contract, heightening the stakes of the match. Around the 6-minute mark, Matt executed a second rope elbow drop on Colten Gunn, resulting in a near fall with a two count.</p><p>A confrontation ensued at ringside as Page and Austin Gunn confronted Isiah “Brother Zay” Kassidy. Austin forcefully removed Kassidy’s bedazzled neck brace, causing Kassidy to sell neck pain by collapsing to the ringside mat and remaining down. Excalibur then announced that the opening ceremonies of the Owen Hart Cup tournament would follow the conclusion of this match.</p><p>As the match progressed, Matt found himself isolated by the opposing team, but he managed to fight back and clear them to ringside. Matt came close to making the tag, but Page and Austin intervened by pulling Jeff and Hook off the apron. Eventually, Jeff was able to tag in and unleashed his offense on both Colten and Austin, securing a two count on Austin with a middle rope splash. However, during the setup for another move from the ropes, Jeff slipped and crashed to the mat.</p><p>Soon after, Hook tagged in and took control against Page. Hook executed a suplex on Page and followed it up with a powerful club to the jaw, but Page countered by throwing him to the mat and delivering a solid kick. Colten then tagged in, and Matt made a blind tag. The Hardys executed a double team move on Colten, with Jeff preparing to ascend the ropes but getting cut off. The Gunns managed to hit their double team finisher on Matt, but Jeff broke up their double pin attempt by performing a Swanton onto both of them.</p><p>In the closing moments, the Hardys executed Twist of Fates on the Gunns, leaving Page alone in the ring with all three babyfaces.
