He is the first Canadian to receive the honor. The Oscar win completed a triumphant return to prominence for Fraser after his number of leading roles slowed in the mid-to-late 2000s. The hiatus was partially on account of a number of health problems, but the actor has also cited personal matters, including a sexual assault he says he experienced in 2003.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 title="Quick Facts" data-anchor-id=quick-facts class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Quick Facts</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="body-tip css-i9osfz e1k3dme10">FULL NAME: Brendan James Fraser<br>BORN: December 3, 1968<br>BIRTHPLACE: Indianapolis, Indiana<br>SPOUSE: Afton Smith (1998-2009)<br>CHILDREN: Griffin, Holden, and Leland<br>ASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Sagittarius</p><h2 data-node-id=11 title="Early Life and Education" data-anchor-id=early-life-and-education class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Early Life and Education</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Brendan James Fraser was born on December 3, 1968, in Indianapolis, Indiana, to Canadian parents Peter and Carol Mary Fraser. Brendan is the youngest of four siblings, including brothers Kevin, Regan, and Sean. He holds dual citizenship in the U.S. and Canada. Prior to his own stardom, Brendan’s claim to fame was his maternal uncle George Genereux, who won a gold medal in trap shooting at the 1952 Olympics in Helsinki, Finland, and was later inducted into Canada’s Sports Hall of Fame.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Peter is a former journalist who moved to the United States to work as a foreign service officer for Canada’s Government Office of Tourism. Because of his position, the family relocated every few years and spent time in multiple countries. These international travels influenced young Brendan in multiple ways. He learned to speak French while living in Ottawa, Ontario, and picked up Dutch in The Hague, Netherlands. Attending theater shows in London as a child from ages 6 through 8 first sparked his interest in acting. He would later study it in school.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Fraser’s early education included stops at a Montessori school in Detroit and the Sacred Heart School in Bellevue, Washington.

As part of their settlement, Fraser was required to pay $900,000 per year in alimony and child support. Four years later, he petitioned a court to reduce the payments and claimed his expenses were more than his declining income. Smith responded by accusing him of “fraud” and hiding movie contracts totaling $9 million at the time of their divorce. If a change was granted, it was never made public. Fraser’s spousal support payments eventually ended in 2019.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=48 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Currently, Fraser is dating Jeanne Moore, a movie and TV hair and makeup artist. They went public with their relationship in September 2022 when they first appeared together at the Venice Film Festival. She also attended the 2023 Oscars ceremony, with Fraser referencing her—and his sons—during his acceptance speech.</p><h2 data-node-id=49 title="Net Worth" data-anchor-id=net-worth class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Net Worth</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=50 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">According to Celebrity Net Worth, Fraser’s net worth is estimated <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/actors/brendan-fraser-net-worth/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="around $20 million" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">around $20 million</a> as of July 2023.
